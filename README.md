- # Hello!
- I’m Esther. I started [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) (an online course from Harvard) in the middle of the pandemic, 
partly to gain a new skill but also to pursue my passion which was found in college.
- It didn't come easy to me at all, yet I felt excited whenever I solved a problem or became more comfortable with a newly-acquired skill.
Though I knew there's still a lot more to learn, I had never been more proud of myself when I received the [completion certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/96cd3908302a4209b8a65fa61ee598a2).
- I've continued on [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) and I'm looking forward to exploring more possibilities in my life!
