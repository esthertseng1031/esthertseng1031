- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Esther.
- ðŸŒ± I started CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course in the middle of the pandemic, 
partly to gain a new skill but also to pursue my passion which was found in college.
It took me about 5 months and didn't come easy to me at all.
Yet I knew that there were no shortcuts and no excuses if I wanted to be proficient one day.
I had never been more proud of myself when I received the completion certificate.
- âœ¨ So, Iâ€™m currently onto the next course: CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.
