- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Esther.
- ðŸŒ± I started CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (an online course from Harvard) in the middle of the pandemic, 
partly to gain a new skill but also to pursue my passion which was found in college.
It didn't come easy to me at all, yet I felt excited whenever I solved a problem or became more comfortable with a newly-acquired skill.
Though I knew there's still a lot more to learn, I had never been more proud of myself when I received the completion certificate.
- âœ¨ I've continued on CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript and I'm looking forward to exploring more possibilities in my life.
